The dataset used was obtained from Physionet-EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset.</br>
It was used a functional convolutional model with 4 branches with varied deepness. It was also created a class model for practice.</br>
The functional model is multi-headed and it was tried to be made modulary, blocks of layers. So it will make testing a faster process and automate some steps.</br>
Reportlab was used to create pdf reports.</br>
The project is in progress.</br>
